## About KeizerPHP (2.0)
<p>Ever wanted to manage a chess club competition with some ease, just from the web? Now it is possible. KeizerPHP (oh boy, what a name) gives you the possibility to do this. Just sign up your club and start using it.</p>

##Help
Okay, to be fair, you can't use it just yet (sorry, sorry, this is just a hobby of me). I'm working on a new release somewhere begin 2021. The sourcecode you are seeing here is not complete. But when you can use it, this page will be updated.

You can then just sign up via https://keizerphp.nl (the homepage of this project is now https://interndepion.nl which runs version 1.0 of KeizerPHP, released in 2020, but that version is old and way too depressing to work on.) 

To check things out by then, use DEMO and password DEMO.
