## About KeizerPHP
<p>This project is made with the Laravel Framework. All rights reserved to the third party vendor packages that make this work.</p>
<p>KeizerPHP is an implementation of Systeem Keizer that is used by chess clubs to pair their internal competition. I try to provide an web-based, open-source alternative for software like Sevilla (JBF) as I missed this.</p>
<p>It is just a hobby project, so if things are broken or if you think things can be better. Please do so. The first version that is now available has loads of features that come in handy:</p>
<ol>
<li>User-system</li>
<li> Competition Configs</li>
<li> Upload Ratinglist to create users, update users</li>
<li> Upload Round Dates</li>
<li> Notifications (WebPush, E-mail, Website)</li>
<li> Absence generator and editing by players themselves.</li>
<li> Pairing</li>
<li> Administrator rights</li>
</ol>

<p>In the future, there will be more:</p>
<ol>
<li> Installation Package</li>
<li> Layouts</li>
<li> Multiple Language Support</li>
<li> Notifications via SMS or WhatsApp</li>
<li> Better Pairing Algorithm</li>
<li> User-configuration system</li>
<li> PGN-games</li>
</ol>
