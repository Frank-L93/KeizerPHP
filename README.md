## About KeizerPHP
<p>This project is made with the Laravel Framework. All rights reserved to the third party vendor packages that make this work.</p>
<p>KeizerPHP is an implementation of Systeem Keizer that is used by chess clubs to pair their internal competition. I try to provide an web-based, open-source alternative for software like Sevilla (JBF) as I missed this.</p>

1. User-system
2. Competition Configs
3. Upload Ratinglist to create users, update users
4. Upload Round Dates
5. Notifications (WebPush, E-mail, Website)
6. Absence generator and editing by players themselves.

8. Administrator rights

<p>In the future, there will be more:</p>
1. Installation Package
2. Layouts
3. Multiple Language Support
4. Notifications via SMS or WhatsApp

6. User-configuration system
7. PGN-games
